## Currently Focused On:
### [Kanapka-AI-Mobile](https://github.com/FylypekUNO/Kanapka-AI-Mobile) (in Android Studio - Java)

Developing a mobile app for the [kanapka-ai](https://github.com/Glider6014/kanapka-ai) project, which was created as part of a creative project during my internship at **Better Collective**.  
As a React+Tailwind enthusiast, I have replaced all XML components and am now attempting to implement a React+Tailwind components system in Java.

Progress:
```java
public class MainPage extends ReactComponent {
  private final String message;
  
  public MainPage(String message) {
    this.message = message;
  }
  
  @Override
  public React render() {
    return div("inset-0 flex items-center justify-center bg-gray-800 bg-opacity-50",
      div("bg-white p-6 rounded shadow-md w-96",
        div("text-2xl mb-4 text-gray-900", "Upgrading Plan"),
        (message != null) ? div("mt-4 text-center text-gray-900", message) : null
      )
    );
  }
}
```
